<h3>< --NoSQL -- ></h3>

NoSQL can mean either Not Only SQL or can be read as No SQL
It implements document oriented data management as opposed to the traditional
Structured Relational DataBase Management Systems which structure and store data in tables rows and columns in a defined way

NoSQL is much more flexible, it allows for the storage of diffent types of data
which do not have to strictly be of a partcular form
